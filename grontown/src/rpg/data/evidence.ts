    It was my pleasure to meet you yesterday at the workers rally. I was so inspired by your passion for your fellow hardworking workers. I must say I have never met anyone quite like you; I would love to chat more over a cup of tea perhaps?

    Mr. Thornton, I understand the difficulty in making the next bond payment. You have been a trustworthy and reliable client over the years, and we sympathize with the recent challenges you have had with Harrington entering the shipping business and all. 
  Therefore, we are willing to grant you an extra thirty days of grace to make your payment. 

Your banker and dear friend,
Reggie Archibald
